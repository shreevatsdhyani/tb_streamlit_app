# tb_streamlit_app

**Problem Statement:**  

Create a **3D visualization** from a **2D chest X-ray image** of a lung that clearly shows the **TB-affected area**, with the following requirements:  

1. **Input:** A **2D chest X-ray image** (from open-source datasets) where the **TB-infected region is clearly labeled**.  
2. **Output:** A **3D-rendered version** of the same lung, highlighting the **TB patch in 3D space**.  
3. **Key Deliverables:**  
   - The **TB-affected area must be clearly marked and distinguishable** in the 3D model.  
   - The **3D reconstruction should be rotatable** for better visualization.  
   - Use **open-source tools/datasets** (e.g., NIH Chest X-ray Dataset, Montgomery TB dataset).  
4. **Deadline:** **1 week** from assignment receipt.  

**Success Criteria:**  
- If the **3D reconstruction accurately represents the TB lesion**, you will be **hired for the internship**.  
- Further details will be provided upon successful completion.  

**Note:** The solution must be **reproducible** and **documented** (code + methodology).
